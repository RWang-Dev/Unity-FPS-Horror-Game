# Unity-First-Person-Shooter-Horror-Game
One of my first fully functional levels in an FPS style game created using Unity Game Engine, Blender, C#, and Visual Studio. 
All of the 3d models present on the scene were made by me using Blender, although you might find some other 3d models I downloaded, but then decided to just make my own.  

The movement controls for this game are the standard WASD keys for moving forward, back, left, and right, along with the spacebar to jump.  
Press the number "1" key to take out your pistol and left mouse button to shoot, while holding down middle mouse button and right mouse button takes out a flashlight and allows you to aim, respectively.  

Try and survive throughout the dark forest while killing the green goblin monsters and attempt to collect 10 soul fragments scattered throughout the map.  

Have fun!
